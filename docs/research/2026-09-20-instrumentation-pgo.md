# Instrumentation PGO for Kotlin/Native — results

**Interim.** Five of the seven research questions have verdicts. The macro half is not finished
and is reported as not measured rather than estimated. Every number here has a backlog item, a
log directory and a command behind it; nothing is carried over from another project or inferred
from a prior.

The pre-registration is [BRIEF.md](../../BRIEF.md), including three sets of amendments and the
reason each was made. The evidence this study started from is
[research-architecture.md](research-architecture.md).

## Verdict table

| RQ | Question | Verdict | |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RQ0** | Can a Kotlin/Native release binary write a `.profraw` that merges, and can the toolchain apply the resulting `.profdata`? | **GREEN** | on the microbenchmark; 916 functions in the profile, 929 of 3 027 defines annotated against 0 before |
| **RQ1** | What share of self CPU is Kotlin code? | **GREY** | 13.84–35.38 % across four endpoints; no endpoint reaches the 40 % green, two are above the 20 % red |
| **RQ2** | Does indirect call promotion fire on Kotlin dispatch, and what is it worth? | **GREEN** | promotion and inlining in the IR at the benchmark's sites; −11.2 % itable and −12.6 % vtable at 99 % confidence |
| **RQ3/RQ4** | Macro effect on the service | **NOT MEASURED** | Route B reaches the service's compiler and fails at its linker, twice |
| **RQ5** | How long does a profile live? | **NOT MEASURED** | conditional on RQ3 |
| **RQ6** | What does it cost in binary size? | **NOT MEASURED** | conditional on RQ3 |
| — | The ruler | **2.92 %** per paired round | ±4.64 % at four counted rounds, ±2.44 % at eight |

**Kill criterion 2 is moot** — it validates a fork as a baseline and there is no fork. Criteria 1,
3, 4, 5 and 6 did not fire.

## The mechanism works, and is worth 11–13 %

RQ2 is the question the case for this study rested on, and the answer is unambiguous. The IR
carries the canonical promoted-and-inlined shape at the benchmark's own dispatch sites:

```llvm
%48 = icmp eq ptr %47, @"kfun:S1#area(kotlin.Long){}kotlin.Long"
br i1 %48, label %if.true.direct_targ.i, label %if.false.orig_indirect.i, !prof !679

if.true.direct_targ.i:
  call void @Kotlin_mm_safePointFunctionPrologue() #162
  %49 = add i64 %acc.1, 1            ; S1.area is x + 1 — the body, inlined
```

Six guarded sites in the PGO arm against **zero** in A0. Nine interleaved rounds, 99 % intervals:

| distribution | measure | A0 ns/op | A2 ns/op | change |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 90/10 | `itable` | 1.642 ± 0.080 | **1.459 ± 0.047** | **−11.2 %** |
| 90/10 | `vtable` | 1.272 ± 0.079 | **1.112 ± 0.044** | **−12.6 %** |
| 90/10 | unit control | 0.791 ± 0.031 | 0.792 ± 0.028 | +0.1 % |
| uniform ×8 | `itable` / `vtable` | — | — | +5.2 % / +3.5 %, intervals overlap |

**Both controls of known outcome hold.** Uniform rotation gains nothing, exactly as the measured
`icp-remaining-percent-threshold = 30` predicts for eight receivers at 12.5 % each.

**And 90/10 gains more than a single receiver does** (−11.2 % against −7.9 %, the latter not
separating). Not an inversion, and the reason is the most transferable thing here:

> **Promotion helps most where the hardware helps least.** With one receiver the indirect-branch
> predictor is already perfect and the guard only adds a compare. At 90/10 it misses a tenth of
> the time, and the guard converts that miss into a well-predicted direct branch.

## The ceiling says the mechanism has nowhere to pay off here

| endpoint | rate | Kotlin self | + runtime | kernel | libc & native |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `GET /health/live` | 960 | 32.55 % | 50.38 % | 23.31 % | 25.69 % |
| `POST /hooks/{id}` | 180 | 21.22 % | 32.33 % | 33.35 % | 31.00 % |
| `GET /api/events` | 120 | 16.40 % | 37.13 % | 14.83 % | 45.91 % |
| `GET /journal` | 48 | 13.84 % | 41.24 % | 13.86 % | 42.83 % |

Each endpoint measured at 50–70 % of its own saturation, every run shown unsaturated, zero
unresolved samples.

**The gradient runs the wrong way for this study.** The endpoint that parses nothing, touches no
database and serialises nothing has twice the Kotlin share of the one that renders a page. PGO's
territory shrinks exactly where the service does work.

**The arithmetic that follows is the study's real answer.** At a 20 % bucket, a 5–15 % return on
the code PGO touches is 1–3 % of a request. The ruler puts the macro bar at `max(5 %, 2 × ruler)`
— 9.3 % at four counted rounds, 5 % at eight. **On every endpoint that does real work the
expected effect is at or below the floor, in the best case.** The mechanism is real; the room for
it on this service is not.

## Where the CPU actually goes, which may outlast the question that was asked

The largest single consumer is **Kotlin/Native's own allocator calling libc malloc**:

| caller above the allocator | ingest | api/events | journal | health |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `CustomAllocator::CreateObject` | 3.70 % | 3.52 % | 4.50 % | 6.50 % |
| `CustomAllocator::CreateArray` | 2.69 % | 5.93 % | 6.87 % | 4.40 % |
| `MainGCThread::PerformFullGC` | 0.71 % | 1.25 % | 1.63 % | 1.26 % |
| `sqlite3MemMalloc` | — | 2.50 % | 2.09 % | — |
| Rust (`sqlx4k`) | — | 0.58 % | 0.46 % | — |

**11.0–18.9 % of all samples have an allocator function as their leaf** — on `/journal` that
exceeds the entire Kotlin bucket. It is not Ktor's buffers and not mostly SQLite. This is what
`pagedAllocator=false` means, and that is the setting the pinned build uses, so the alternative is
a build property rather than only an `LD_PRELOAD` probe. Allocator work is a non-goal of this
brief, so this is recorded outside the verdicts.

## What the brief got wrong, and it was worth finding

**There is no fork.** The brief's fixed setup says *"the pipeline has to be changed, and a stock
distribution cannot be"*. At 2.4.20 the stock compiler exposes `-Xllvm-module-passes`, which
replaces the module optimisation pipeline string outright, plus `-Xsave-llvm-ir-after` and
`-Xcompile-from-bitcode`. And `llvm-21-x86_64-linux-dev-116` — the exact bundle
`konan.properties` names — was already installed, carrying `opt`, `llvm-profdata`,
`libclang_rt.profile.a` and `pgo-instr-gen`, `pgo-instr-use`, `instrprof`, `pgo-icall-prom`.

**The patch set is two build-level changes**, neither in the compiler: a property so Route B's
flags reach the build, and a replaced object in the profile-runtime archive.

**Arm A4 has to be restated.** Its implicit model is that a profile from an unrelated workload is
largely rejected. **Two unrelated Kotlin/Native programs share 2 933 of 2 938 defines — 99.8 % of
the module**, because the runtime and stdlib dominate. A wrong profile is accepted almost
everywhere, with wrong counts; the discriminator is the count distribution, not the applied
fraction.

**The offered rate is part of the gate.** A saturated endpoint reports 3.7× the Kotlin share:
`/journal` read 55.55 % saturated and 14.92 % clean. The brief fixed a rate per endpoint and never
said how to choose one.

**The gate thresholds were sized against a bar that did not exist.** 40 % and 20 % were set
against a 5 % macro bar before the ruler was measured. At the measured bar of 9.3 % with four
rounds, even a green RQ1 could not have cleared it.

## What is not measured, and why

**RQ3, RQ4, RQ5, RQ6.** Route B reaches the service's compiler — 71 MB of IR, instrumented in 9.3
seconds — and fails at its linker for two reasons invisible on a microbenchmark:

1. `undefined hidden symbol: _DYNAMIC`. The pinned arm links `-static`; the profile runtime's
   binary-id writer needs a dynamic executable. **The profile runtime and a fully static link are
   incompatible as shipped.**
2. `undefined symbol: rd_kafka_conf_new` and the rest. **`-Xcompile-from-bitcode` loses the native
   dependency graph** — `DependenciesTracker` builds it from the klib graph, and resuming from
   bitcode has no klib graph. No flag supplies it.

Both are surmountable and both make the measured binary less like the pinned one, which is the
reason they were not simply done.

**The GC log** RQ1 was to carry: `-Xruntime-logs=gc=info` is a compile-time flag the subject's
build does not expose. The collector's *share* is measured by symbol; its pause and sweep times
are not.

**The inclusive column is a lower bound.** 21.9–33.6 % of stacks have no callers, because
optimised Kotlin/Native omits frame pointers. `--call-graph dwarf` does not work here at all —
zero stacks on a control that the frame-pointer capture profiles fine — and three candidate
mechanisms were ruled out without finding the cause.

## Claims withdrawn during the work

- *"Longer settling halves the spread."* The unpaired estimator was being fooled by a monotonic
  drift; the paired estimator barely moves with settle length.
- *"The real subject runs in a container."* Two harnesses live in xyk's `bench/`; the grep found
  the older single-host one.
- *"razves is the instrument for RQ1's buckets."* It cannot read a `perf.data`; its `profile`
  command consumes its own sampler's dump.
- *"The runtime and Rust cannot be separated by mangling on this subject."* True of razves's
  reader; this Rust emits v0 mangling, and perf demangles both.
- *"`kfun:` is one Kotlin prefix of twelve, so the bucket must be widened."* Widening cannot
  change a self-sample share: of 11 804 `FUNC` symbols, every Kotlin-prefixed one is `kfun:`.

## The instrument, and what it cost to trust it

Fifteen defects were found in this study's own harnesses, and every one of them produced evidence
indistinguishable from a real result: a check that compared a value with itself; two idle gates
that could never open; two `pkill -f` patterns matching their own command line; a driver that
exited zero after failing; a profiler pointed at the wrong pid; a capture of a binary that had
been deleted; an identity implementation that made a benchmark loop dead; a receiver index whose
cost differed between arms; repeats that were not interleaved; and a unit control that separated
by 31.5 % on a measure performing no dispatch.

**The last of those is the one to keep.** Each guard that caught something was cheap, and none of
them would have been added by someone confident the measurement was fine.
